# API Security

## Overview of API Security

APIs, which stand for Application Programming Interfaces, play a role, in shaping up applications. They allow different applications to communicate and share data with services or platforms. By using APIs businesses can easily connect with platforms and third party services creating solutions that combine various elements. This modular approach to app development empowers developers to tap into existing services functionality encourages code reuse speeds up development processes and boosts overall productivity. APIs serve as the foundation for modern apps due to their ability to separate and distribute business logic. They are the key mechanism for transforming traditional applications into architectures based on APIs.

### Common API Vulnerabilities

* Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
* Broken User Authentication
* Improper Asset Management
* Excessive Data Exposure
* Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
* Broken Function Level Authorization
* Mass Assignment
* Injection

**1. A BOLA API vulnerability** happens when information in an object is not properly safeguarded. This occurs when the server doesn't fully adhere to the state of the client and instead relies more on the object IDs provided by the client to determine which object to access.

For instance if a users information isn't securely shielded in an API response sent back to their browser or mobile device attackers could exploit this data to impersonate the legitimate user and gain entry, to their account. Such vulnerabilities are prevalent in applications that utilize APIs.

*Is there a way to stop it?*

One way to prevent BOLA attacks is by implementing an API security solution that can understand the specific logic of an API and identify when an authenticated user attempts to access data belonging to another user without permission

**2. Broken User Authentication**

Broken Authentication and Session Management is a security vulnerability that occurs when the authentication and session management mechanisms of a web application are flawed or improperly implemented.

The flaw in a web applications authentication and session management systems is known as broken authentication and session management. This vulnerability arises from weaknesses or incorrect implementations in how users are logged in and how their sessions are handled.

*Is there a way to stop it?*

To ensure API security it's crucial to analyze the standard authentication process for each key workflow. This allows for the identification of activities such, as authentication requests that deviate from the usual order.

**3. Improper Asset Management**
Hackers discover less secure versions of the API, such as staging, testing, beta or older releases that lack the same level of security as the production API. They exploit these vulnerabilities to carry out their attacks.

In modern environments with DevOps, cloud infrastructure, containers, and Kubernetes, managing multiple deployments—such as development, testing, feature branches, staging, and older versions—is simplified. However, the need to maintain backward compatibility often results in outdated APIs remaining operational. These old or non-production versions are frequently neglected in terms of security and maintenance, despite having access to production data. As a result, once an attacker authenticates through a vulnerable endpoint, they may exploit this by switching to more secure production endpoints, posing a significant security risk.

*Is there a way to stop it?*
To safeguard your systems stay on top of your inventory of API hosts. Restrict access to sensitive information that shouldn't be publicly available. Control access to production data and separate it from non production data. Introduce external security measures like API firewalls. Ensure proper decommissioning of versions of APIs or apply security patches to them. Enforce authentication protocols, redirect mechanisms CORS policies and similar safeguards.

**4. Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**
Scenario of use
Malicious actors overwhelm the API with a flood of requests beyond its capacity to manage.
They bombard the API with requests faster than it can process them causing congestion.
The request sizes or certain fields within them surpass the APIs processing capabilities.
“Zip bombs” are compressed files crafted to consume an amount of resources when extracted overwhelming the API.

Here are some strategies to enhance security for your API. Establish rate limiting to control the number of requests from users. Set restrictions on the size of incoming payloads. Customize the rate limiting based on the specific API methods, clients or IP addresses that require access. Implement checks on compression ratios to prevent abuse. Lastly define resource limits for your containers to ensure efficient usage.

**5. Mass Assignment**
Mass Assignment allows users to submit data that is then used to update the corresponding model attributes with ease. It streamlines the process, enabling developers to set multiple attributes of a model using a single request, which significantly enhances efficiency and user experience.

However, behind this seemingly convenient feature lies a potential Pandora's box. If not handled diligently, Mass Assignment can become a lurking vulnerability, granting unauthorized users access to sensitive areas and the ability to tamper with critical data. One wrong move and your application might be susceptible to data breaches, malicious exploits, and even complete system compromise

*Is there a way to stop it?*
An API security solution capable of continuously mapping behavior patterns and detecting anomalies beyond the norm should have the ability to identify the information gathering stage of a potential attacker.

**6. Injection**

Injection consists of sending an API malicious commands through a user input field, whether a text input, file upload, or other means. This attack vector allows malicious actors to send code or other executable commands to the API’s interpreter, which can be used to bypass security, change permissions, access information, damage, or disable the API. Common injections include cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injections, and template injections.

*Is there a way to stop it?*
API validates and cleans the data, relying on a “single, trustworthy, and actively maintained library”. The workflow thus involves a user submitting an input, whether through a text field or as a file, and the API “using sufficient filters to only allow valid values for each input parameter.” Syntax is not adapted for the target interpreter should be discarded entirely. While these controls are often built into languages and frameworks by default, it is important to ensure these components are kept up to date and are actually in use.

### Authentication and Authorization Best Practices

* Use Strong Authentication Mechanisms: Prefer token-based mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 and JWT for their robustness and suitability for RESTful APIs.
* Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling: Protect APIs against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of authentication attempts.
* Employ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security beyond just passwords or tokens for critical applications.
* Regularly Rotate and Refresh Tokens: Prevent token misuse by setting expiration and enabling automatic token refresh mechanisms.
* Secure Token Storage and Transmission: Always use HTTPS for API calls and securely store tokens to prevent leakage.
* Monitor and Log Authentication Attempts: Keep a close eye on authentication patterns to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

### Encryption and Data Protection

Use strong encryption, such as SSL/TLS, to protect data transmitted over the network. Validate and sanitize all input received from clients and other sources to prevent common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

In computing, encryption is primarily used to protect data in one of two instances. The first is to protect data at rest. An example of data at rest is a spreadsheet with data located on the hard drive of a desktop or laptop computer. The second is to protect data in motion. An example of data in motion is using a web browser to get data from a remote server.

#### Encrypting data at rest

* **Whole Disk Encryption**: All data stored on portable devices (e.g., PDAs, tablets, laptops, smartphones) and storage media (e.g., CDs, DVDs, USB drives) should be encrypted using a whole disk encryption tool or one that can encrypt all Confidential data.

* **File Encryption (File-by-File)**: Confidential data should be encrypted on a file-by-file basis to securely transfer files over a network without transmission encryption or to store them on offline devices (e.g., CDs, DVDs, USB drives).

* **Database Storage Encryption**: Confidential data in databases should be encrypted either through whole disk encryption or features native to the database software, enabling encryption of specific tables or columns and managing access rights across multiple applications using the same database.

#### Encrypting data in motion

* **File Transfers**: Confidential file transfers should use encrypted transmission protocols or services (e.g., SCP, SFTP) or ensure files are encrypted prior to transmission.

* **E-mail**: Confidential email content should be encrypted before transmission, delivered via a secure web application, or encrypted in a secure message format to protect against unauthorized access during delivery.

* **Interactive Sessions**: Confidential data, including login passwords, transmitted during remote login sessions (e.g., Telnet, TN3270) should be encrypted using secure applications or protocols like SSH.

* **Web-Based Applications**: Confidential data transmitted between a browser and a web application should be encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS/SSL), and only necessary data should be displayed for authorized users.

* **Remote File Services**: Confidential data transmitted by remote file services should be encrypted using protocols like IPSec, ISAKMP/IKE, or SSL/TLS to prevent unauthorized interception.

* **Database Access**: Confidential data transmitted between an application server and a database should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized interception, using encryption capabilities provided by the database server software.

* **Application-to-Application Communications**: Confidential data transmitted between applications should be encrypted using commonly available protocols (e.g., SOAP with HTTPS) to protect against unauthorized interception.

* **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: VPNs provide an additional layer of protection for confidential data transmitted over networks, and their use should be considered carefully with consultation from OIT Security to address all security and networking concerns.

### Case Studies of API Breaches

#### Instagram

Background: In January 2021, a major data breach occurred when a database of account information at the company Social Arks was exposed due to a misconfigured database. This breach affected approximately 214 million social media accounts, covering 318 million records. The leak was attributed to a misconfigured database that allowed unauthorized access without requiring a password.

API Vulnerability: The vulnerability stemmed from a misconfigured database, which allowed anyone to access the data without proper authentication. The exposed information was not encrypted, making it accessible to anyone who could connect to the database. While web scraping (collecting publicly available data) is not illegal outright, scraping on most social media platforms violates their terms and conditions. Instagram, like other popular social media services, prohibits scraping. In this case, the scraped information included sensitive data from millions of accounts.

Impact: The breach exposed personal information, potentially leading to identity theft or other fraudulent activities. Although account passwords were not compromised, the leak of email addresses and phone numbers raised privacy concerns.

#### Dropbox

Background: In May 2024, Dropbox experienced a significant security breach that impacted its Dropbox Sign service. Dropbox Sign is an “eSignature solution” that allows users to send, sign, and store important documents within the Dropbox platform. Unfortunately, unknown, and unauthorized entities gained access to customer data related to all users of Dropbox Sign. This included emails, usernames, and general account settings. The incident raised concerns about the security practices surrounding this service.

API Vulnerability: The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in Dropbox Sign’s API. The threat actor accessed not only user data but also certain authentication information. For subsets of users, the attacker obtained phone numbers, hashed passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication details. Additionally, third parties who had received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign (without creating an account) had their email addresses and names exposed. The api vulnerability stemmed from an automated system configuration tool within Dropbox Sign, which the attacker exploited.

Impact: Thankfully, there’s no evidence that the attacker accessed the contents of users’ accounts or payment information. However, the breach highlighted the importance of robust API security practices. Dropbox Sign’s infrastructure is largely separate from other Dropbox services, which may have limited the impact on other products.

### Future Trends in API Security

1. **The Role of AI in API Security**:
   Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing API security by enhancing threat detection and response capabilities. AI can analyze large volumes of API traffic in real-time, identifying anomalies, suspicious patterns, and potential attacks with greater accuracy than traditional methods. ML algorithms can also adapt over time, learning from new threats to strengthen API defenses against evolving attack vectors.

2. **API Security in IoT**:
   As IoT devices proliferate, securing APIs in these environments presents unique challenges due to the vast number of devices and their varying security capabilities. IoT APIs often face threats like weak authentication, data exposure, and insufficient encryption. Ensuring robust security involves implementing strong encryption, secure authentication methods, and endpoint security to protect the data exchanged between IoT devices and cloud services.

3. **API Security for Microservices and Serverless Architectures**

   Microservices and serverless architectures have become essential for modern cloud-native applications, but they introduce new security challenges due to the decentralized nature of API communication. Best practices for securing APIs in these environments include enforcing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, securing communication with TLS, implementing fine-grained access controls, and continuously monitoring API interactions to detect potential breaches.

### Conclusion

With the rising significance of APIs in facilitating data exchange, authentication and authorization comes an increased risk of exploitation by malicious individuals. The impact of API vulnerabilities can be serious leading to financial setbacks privacy breaches and identity theft. It is crucial for developers, security experts and organizations to prioritize API security through measures like robust authentication, encryption, rate limiting and routine vulnerability assessments to mitigate the chances of misuse. This proactive approach helps safeguard sensitive data uphold user trust and preserve the integrity of our digital environments.
